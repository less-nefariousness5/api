-- Sandbox file I O
--
-- This scripting environment is sandboxed on purpose to prevent malicious code.
-- You can only interact with files in two allowed locations:
--
-- 1) Game files, inside the World of Warcraft installation folder
--    Used by: core.read_file, core.read_file_partial, core.get_file_size
--
-- 2) Loader data files, inside the loader's scripts_data folder
--    Used by: core.create_data_file, core.create_data_folder, core.write_data_file
--             core.read_data_file, core.read_data_file_partial, core.get_data_file_size
--
-- Any attempt to access files outside these locations will fail.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- Reads the entire contents of a sandboxed game file.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Only files inside the World of Warcraft installation folder are accessible.
--- - Any path outside the WoW folder is blocked.
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is treated as a path inside the WoW folder.
--- - Use relative-style paths such as `Data/...` or `_retail_/...` depending on your client layout.
---
--- Returns:
--- - On success: the full file contents as a Lua string.
--- - On failure: typically an empty string or nil depending on native implementation.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local text = core.read_file("_retail_/WTF/Config.wtf")
--- print("Config length:", #text)
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside the World of Warcraft folder (UTF-8).
---@return string data The file contents as a Lua string.
function core.read_file(filename)
    return ""
end

--- Reads a portion of a sandboxed game file, starting at a byte offset.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Only files inside the World of Warcraft installation folder are accessible.
--- - Any path outside the WoW folder is blocked.
--- - Returns nil if the file cannot be read (missing, outside scope, access denied, etc).
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is treated as a path inside the WoW folder.
--- - Use relative-style paths such as `Data/...` or `_retail_/...` depending on your client layout.
---
--- Notes:
--- - `offset` and `size_to_read` are in bytes.
--- - The returned string can contain binary data and may include zero bytes.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local p = "_retail_/WTF/Config.wtf"
--- local chunk = core.read_file_partial(p, 0, 64)
--- if chunk then
---   print("First 64 bytes:", chunk)
--- else
---   print("Read failed (outside sandbox, missing, or access denied).")
--- end
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside the World of Warcraft folder (UTF-8).
---@param offset integer Byte offset to start reading from.
---@param size_to_read integer Number of bytes to read.
---@return string|nil data The read bytes as a Lua string, or nil on failure.
function core.read_file_partial(filename, offset, size_to_read)
    return ""
end

--- Gets the size of a sandboxed game file in bytes.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Only files inside the World of Warcraft installation folder are accessible.
--- - Any path outside the WoW folder is blocked.
---
--- Notes:
--- - If the file does not exist or is not accessible, the native side may return 0.
--- - If you need to distinguish "missing" vs "empty file", attempt a small read as well.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local p = "_retail_/WTF/Config.wtf"
--- local size = core.get_file_size(p)
--- if size > 0 then
---   print("Config size:", size)
--- else
---   print("Missing, blocked, or empty file.")
--- end
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside the World of Warcraft folder (UTF-8).
---@return integer size The file size in bytes.
function core.get_file_size(filename)
    return 0
end

--- Creates a new data file inside the loader's `scripts_data/` directory.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Data files are stored under: `<loader_path>/scripts_data/`
--- - Only this directory is writable by scripts (by design).
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Parent folders should exist. Use core.create_data_folder for subfolders if needed.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- core.create_data_file("settings.json")
--- core.write_data_file("settings.json", "{}")
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.
---@return nil
function core.create_data_file(filename)
    return nil
end

--- Creates a folder inside the loader's `scripts_data/` directory.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Folders are created under: `<loader_path>/scripts_data/`
--- - Only this directory is writable by scripts (by design).
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `folder` is relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- core.create_data_folder("profiles")
--- core.create_data_file("profiles/user1.json")
--- ```
---
---@param folder string Folder path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.
---@return nil
function core.create_data_folder(folder)
    return nil
end

--- Writes data to a loader data file inside `scripts_data/`.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Files are written under: `<loader_path>/scripts_data/`
--- - Only this directory is writable by scripts (by design).
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
---
--- Notes:
--- - The write behavior (overwrite vs append) depends on native implementation.
---   In most systems this overwrites the file.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- core.write_data_file("cache/state.txt", "last_login=123")
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.
---@param data string The data to write into the file.
---@return nil
function core.write_data_file(filename, data)
    return nil
end

--- Reads the entire contents of a loader data file from `scripts_data/`.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Files are read from: `<loader_path>/scripts_data/`
--- - You cannot access arbitrary PC files via this API.
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Returned string can contain binary data.
--- - If the file cannot be read, the native side may return an empty string or nil depending on implementation.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local json = core.read_data_file("settings.json")
--- if json and #json > 0 then
---   print("settings.json:", json)
--- end
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.
---@return string data The file contents as a Lua string.
function core.read_data_file(filename)
    return ""
end

--- Creates a new log file.
---
--- Purpose:
--- - Log files are intended for diagnostics and debugging output.
--- - The exact storage location is implementation-defined by the loader.
---
--- Notes:
--- - If the log file already exists, the native side may truncate it or keep it, depending on implementation.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- core.create_log_file("combat.log")
--- core.write_log_file("combat.log", "addon started")
--- ```
---
---@param filename string The name of the log file to create.
---@return nil
function core.create_log_file(filename)
    return nil
end

--- Writes a message to a log file.
---
--- Purpose:
--- - Use this for debug output that should persist outside the in-game console.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Whether a newline is automatically appended depends on native implementation.
---   If you want one, include "\n" yourself.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- core.write_log_file("combat.log", "Target acquired: " .. tostring(unit_name) .. "\n")
--- ```
---
---@param filename string The name of the log file to write to.
---@param message string The message to write into the log file.
---@return nil
function core.write_log_file(filename, message)

--- Reads a portion of a loader data file from `scripts_data/`, starting at a byte offset.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Files are read from: `<loader_path>/scripts_data/`
--- - You cannot access arbitrary PC files via this API.
--- - Returns nil if the data file cannot be read (missing, not permitted, etc).
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `filename` is resolved relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
---
--- Notes:
--- - `offset` and `size_to_read` are in bytes.
--- - The returned string can contain binary data and may include zero bytes.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local name = "settings.json" -- resolved as: <loader_path>/scripts_data/settings.json
--- local chunk = core.read_data_file_partial(name, 0, 256)
--- if chunk then

--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.
---@param offset integer Byte offset to start reading from.

--- Gets the size of a loader data file in bytes, from `scripts_data/`.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Only files inside the loader's `scripts_data/` directory are accessible.
---
--- Notes:
--- - If the file does not exist or is not accessible, the native side may return 0.
--- - If you need to distinguish "missing" vs "empty file", attempt a small partial read as well.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local name = "settings.json"
--- local size = core.get_data_file_size(name)
--- if size > 0 then
---   print("settings.json size:", size)
--- else
---   print("Missing, blocked, or empty file.")
--- end
--- ```
---
---@param filename string Path inside `scripts_data/` (UTF-8), relative to the loader data directory.

function core.get_data_file_size(filename)
    return 0
end

--- Lists all files and folders in a directory inside `scripts_data/`.
---
--- Sandbox scope:
--- - Only directories inside the loader's `scripts_data/` directory are accessible.
--- - Any path outside `scripts_data/` will return nil.
---
--- Path rules:
--- - `directory` is relative to `scripts_data/`.
--- - Do not prefix with `scripts_data/` yourself.
--- - Use forward slashes or backslashes as path separators.
---
--- Returns:
--- - On success: a table (array) of file names in the directory.
--- - On failure: nil (path outside sandbox, doesn't exist, or not a directory).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Only returns file/folder names, not full paths.
--- - Includes both files and subdirectories.
--- - Does not include "." or ".." entries.

---
--- Overloads:
--- 1) core.http_get(url, callback)
--- 2) core.http_get(url, headers, callback)
---
--- Headers:
--- - `headers` is a table<string, string>
--- - Each pair is sent as: "Key: Value"
---
--- Callback parameters:
--- - `http_code` integer, HTTP status code (200, 404, etc). Transport failure may be 0 (native-defined).
--- - `content_type` string, server content type (native-defined on failure).
--- - `response_data` string, raw response body, binary safe.
--- - `response_headers` string, response headers dump, format is native-defined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- GRAPHICS, TEXTURES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

core.graphics = core.graphics or {}

--- Loads a GPU texture from raw image bytes.
---
--- Common usage patterns:
--- 1) Load from a local file in `scripts_data/`
---    - Read the file bytes with `core.read_data_file("path.png")`
---    - Pass bytes to `core.graphics.load_texture(bytes)`
---
--- 2) Load from an HTTP download (less common)
---    - Download bytes via `core.http_get(...)`
---    - Pass bytes to `core.graphics.load_texture(response_data)`
---
--- Native behavior:
--- - Returns nil if the image bytes cannot be decoded.
--- - Returns `texture_id` if texture is already loaded or already queued.
--- - Returns `texture_id, width, height` only when newly queued.
---
--- Notes:
--- - `texture_id` is a numeric handle used by `core.graphics.draw_texture`.
--- - The bytes string may contain binary data and zero bytes.
---
---@param image_data string Raw image bytes (binary-safe Lua string).
---@return integer|nil texture_id Texture handle, or nil on failure.
---@return integer|nil width Width in pixels (only returned when newly created).
---@return integer|nil height Height in pixels (only returned when newly created).
function core.graphics.load_texture(image_data)
  return nil
end

--- Draws a previously loaded texture.
---
--- Typical usage:
--- - Load once, store `texture_id` in a variable.
--- - Draw every frame (inside your render callback or equivalent).
---
--- Parameters:
--- - `texture_id` integer, returned by `core.graphics.load_texture`
--- - `top_left` vec2, screen position
--- - `width` number, draw width in pixels
--- - `height` number, draw height in pixels
--- - `color` optional, tint color (defaults to white)
--- - `is_for_window` optional boolean, defaults false (background). True draws in current window.
---

-- EXAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--[[----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example A, Most common, Load a local texture from scripts_data and draw every frame

Goal:
- Put `icons/sword.png` under: <loader_path>/scripts_data/icons/sword.png
- Load it once at startup
- Draw it each frame

Files:
- You distribute a script that, on first run, expects the file to exist inside scripts_data.
- Later, our library will automate ensuring files exist, downloading, caching, etc.

Code:

local sword_tex_id = nil
local sword_w, sword_h = 0, 0

local function load_sword_icon_once()
  if sword_tex_id ~= nil then
    return
  end

  local bytes = core.read_data_file("icons/sword.png")
  if not bytes or #bytes == 0 then
    core.log("Missing icon: scripts_data/icons/sword.png")
    return
  end

  local tex_id, w, h = core.graphics.load_texture(bytes)
  if not tex_id then
    core.log("Failed to decode icon: icons/sword.png")
    return
  end

  sword_tex_id = tex_id
  sword_w = w or sword_w
  sword_h = h or sword_h

  core.log("Loaded sword icon, texture_id=" .. tostring(sword_tex_id) ..
           ", w=" .. tostring(sword_w) .. ", h=" .. tostring(sword_h))
end

local function on_render()
  -- Ensure it is loaded once before drawing
  load_sword_icon_once()

  if sword_tex_id then
    local pos = vec2.new(20, 20)
    core.graphics.draw_texture(sword_tex_id, pos, 32, 32)
  end
end

-- Register your render callback as appropriate for your environment:
-- core.register_callback("render", on_render)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------]]

--[[----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example B, Download once (if missing), save to scripts_data, load once, draw every frame

Goal:
- If icons/sword.png is missing locally, download it.
- Save it into scripts_data for next launch.
- Load it into GPU once.
- Draw every frame.

Important lifecycle concept:
- Download and file write happens once (or rarely).
- Texture load happens once (or whenever you need to refresh).
- draw_texture happens every frame.

Code:

local remote_icon_url = "https://dummyimage.com/64x64/000/fff.png"
local remote_icon_path = "icons/remote_icon.png"

local remote_tex_id = nil

local remote_requested = false

local function load_remote_icon_from_disk_once()
  if remote_tex_id ~= nil then
    return true
  end

  local bytes = core.read_data_file(remote_icon_path)
  if not bytes or #bytes == 0 then
    return false
  end

  local tex_id, w, h = core.graphics.load_texture(bytes)
  if not tex_id then
    core.log("Failed to decode icon after reading from disk: " .. remote_icon_path)
    return false

  remote_tex_id = tex_id

  remote_h = h or remote_h
  return true
end

local function ensure_remote_icon_available()
  -- 1) If already loaded from disk, done.
  if load_remote_icon_from_disk_once() then
    return
  end

  -- 2) If not on disk, request download once.
  if remote_requested then
    return
  end
  remote_requested = true

  -- Ensure folder exists
  core.create_data_folder("icons")

  core.http_get(remote_icon_url, function(code, content_type, body, headers)
    if code ~= 200 or not body or #body == 0 then
      core.log("Download failed, code=" .. tostring(code) .. ", type=" .. tostring(content_type))
      remote_requested = false
      return
    end

    -- Persist to scripts_data so we do not re-download next time
    core.create_data_file(remote_icon_path)
    core.write_data_file(remote_icon_path, body)

    -- Load into GPU once
    local tex_id, w, h = core.graphics.load_texture(body)
    if not tex_id then
      core.log("Downloaded icon, but decode failed: " .. remote_icon_path)
